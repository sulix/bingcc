# This builds a version of libSDL 1.2 which is pretty impressively compatible.
# You'll need to have all of the development libraries installed: Xlib, Pulse,
# ALSA, etc. You'll also need the 32-bit versions.
# This builds both 32 and 64 bit versions of SDL (on my ubuntu 12.10 amd64
# system). They'll be installed in ./libs(-32). Note that it'll
# break pretty impressively on non-x86_64 systems at the moment.
# Have fun,
